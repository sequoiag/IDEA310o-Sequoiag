Whats been done:
  My main menu UI has been completed with a working play button! I also have an animation for my settings panel.
The player can move with appropriate camera movement in the first level. After the second level the game goes back to 
the main menu. I implemented an enemy UI, which moves around randomly unless the player is in its range. There are moving
living objects in my second level that move back and forth. I also added audio to all the scenes!

What needs to be done:
  I need to complete the first and second level, I am not satisfied with the amount of objects in the scene. I also want to make the evil 
objects be able to throw cones and damage the player. I want to make a third level, in addition to cleaning up my first two levels. I also 
need to fix my settings buttons in the main menu because they don't work. In addition I want to adjust my player movement with the camera because 
sometimes it feels confusing when the player looks right but W for forward is not adjusted. I also want to adjust my camera movement in the second 
level, because the spacing was weird and I haven't figured out whats wrong yet. I also want to implement pickups for my character!


Challenges:
  I am having some issues implementing my enemies. I also am struggling a little bit with figuring out camera movement. In addition I am having
some struggles with box colliders not working.

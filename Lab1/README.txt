Creator Kit: First Person Shooter Tutorial

For this project I decided to go with the shooter tutorial. I found the overall tutorial very easy to follow, 
and educational. I feel like I struggled with building the rooms the way I wanted them. I broke my mouse before
I started this assignment and have not gotten the chance to get a new one yet. I feel like this made it difficult 
to move around my screen and place things exactly where I wanted them. Iâ€™m relatively proud of my gun's name. I found 
it clever. I think I am also proud of how well I understood the assignment. I have taken a unity class before so I feel
like it was nice to learn new ways to do things in unity, and perhaps even easier ways.
